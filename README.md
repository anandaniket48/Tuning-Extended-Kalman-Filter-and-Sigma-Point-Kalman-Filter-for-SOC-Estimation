# Tuning-Extended-Kalman-Filter-and-Sigma-Point-Kalman-Filter-for-SOC-Estimation
Learned Kalman filters must be "tuned" by adjusting their process-noise, sensor-noise, and initial state-estimate covariance matrices in order to give acceptable performance over a wide range of operating scenarios. This project will give some experience on hand-tuning both an EKF and SPKF for SOC estimation
